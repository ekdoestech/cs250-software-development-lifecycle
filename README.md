## Final Project Artifact

- **Sprint Review and Retrospective:** [View here](./final-project/Sprint_Review_and_Retrospective.pdf)

This document summarizes sprint outcomes, stakeholder-facing results, and a retrospective action plan for the next iteration.

## Portfolio Reflection

### How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
I interpret user needs by translating requests into clear, testable requirements and validating them through feedback. User stories help because they keep the focus on *who* needs something, *what* they need, and *why it matters*. Writing stories with acceptance criteria reduces ambiguity, aligns the team on scope, and creates a shared definition of “done” that can be tested and reviewed.

### How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
I approach development iteratively: start with the highest-value features, build a working increment, gather feedback, and refine. Agile practices I plan to carry forward include maintaining a prioritized backlog, writing user stories with acceptance criteria, using sprint planning to set a realistic goal, and holding retrospectives to continuously improve the team’s process. I also want to keep work visible through task boards and use a clear Definition of Done to protect quality.

### What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
Being a good team member means communicating early and often, keeping commitments transparent, and prioritizing the team’s success over individual preferences. It also means giving and receiving feedback respectfully, helping remove blockers, and contributing to shared quality standards (documentation, testing, code reviews, and meeting agreed definitions of done). A strong team member supports collaboration, keeps stakeholders informed, and stays adaptable when requirements or constraints change.
